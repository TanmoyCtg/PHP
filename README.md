# PHP
Here, I write and document all my php code. I also make some project for my future work!

<h1>How to create cookies in php?</h1>
<p>setcookie() creates the cookie.The setcookie() function must appear BEFORE the <html> tag
 You need user name and value. Then set the username in a variable like $cookie_name.
  <h2>How to delete the cookie?</h2>
  setcookie("user",time()-3600);
</p>
